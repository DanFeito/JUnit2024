Welcome to the **JUnit 2024 Course Repository**! This project serves as the foundation for learning and practicing JUnit testing concepts. It is a **Spring Boot** application built using **Maven** to demonstrate unit testing best practices.

## Project Overview

This repository is designed for the JUnit section of the course, providing examples and exercises to learn how to:
- Write effective unit tests
- Use assertions in JUnit
- Test Spring Boot applications
- Integrate JUnit with Maven for continuous testing
- Apply mocking frameworks like Mockito

## Prerequisites

To get started with this repository, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Java 21** (or a compatible version)
- **Maven** (version 3.8.1 or later)
- **Git**
